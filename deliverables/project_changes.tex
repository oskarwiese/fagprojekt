	\section*{Gantt Chart}
	\noindent The original development of certain milestones and key achievements during the project writing process is visualized in the Gantt chart shown below.

	Comparing this chart to the actual progress of the report writing, it is evident that it has been followed surprisingly well. As it seem wasteful to make strikingly similar classifers for the same task, the milestones of implementing the first classifier and creating the final classifer was merged into one. It also took longer, as some minor mistakes were made during the implementation. The bias correction algorithm took much longer to implement, as this turned out to be the same stage of the project as finishing results and coding. As such, this milestone was reached closer to the end of April than the middle of March. As we are in line with the further progression of the Gantt chart (and since one of the last major milestones is writing the rest of the report), this will continue to be a guide moving forward.
	
	\section*{Learning Objectives}
	The original learning objectives were to:
	\begin{itemize}
		\itemsep-0.1cm
		\item examine and understand bias in the COMPAS dataset
		\item get an understanding of the process of writing and creating bigger group projects
		\item limit the project in such a way as to only convey the necessary information
		\item understand the ethics behind AI and ML models
	\end{itemize}
	
	After almost 13 weeks of writing the project, some of the learning objectives have taken a different direction. Bias understand has generally taken a backseat in order to instead put more focus on the important aspects – defining the used definitions of bias and using them practically to remove bias. Limiting the scope of the project will be important near the end of the writing process, but has not yet been given thought, since the general structure of the report, at this point in time, is still very open. The rest of the learning objectives still complement future work on the project.
